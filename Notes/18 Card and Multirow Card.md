### Card and Multirow Card Visuals in Power BI  
ðŸ“Š **Use Card and Multirow Card visuals to display key metrics clearly and concisely in your reports. These visuals are excellent for summarizing important data points, such as totals or averages, and making them stand out.**

---

### **1. Card Visual**

A **Card Visual** is used to display a single data point, typically used to highlight key metrics such as total sales, total profit, or the number of customers. It focuses on showing one number in a large, bold format to make it easily noticeable. 

---

#### **Real-time Scenario Example**:
   - **Use Case**: A financial dashboard that tracks total revenue for the month.
     - The **Card Visual** displays the total monthly revenue as a single, prominent number (e.g., "$1.2M").
     - **Result**: Business leaders can quickly glance at the dashboard and immediately see the most critical data point, in this case, total revenue.

---

#### **Advantages**:
   - **Simple and Clear**: Provides a single, clear number thatâ€™s easy to read and understand.
   - **Focuses on Key Metrics**: Ideal for highlighting the most important data points in a report or dashboard.
   - **Minimal Space Requirement**: Uses very little space, allowing you to display multiple card visuals in one dashboard.

---

#### **Disadvantages/Challenges**:
   - **Limited Information**: Displays only one number, so it doesnâ€™t provide additional context or trends.
   - **No Comparison or Trend Data**: Doesnâ€™t show how the number compares to previous periods or how it has changed over time.
   - **Static**: Not interactive, meaning users canâ€™t drill down or filter the data.

---

#### **Key Formatting Tips**:
   1. **Font Size and Color**: Use large, bold fonts and clear colors to make the number stand out.
   2. **Data Label Customization**: Customize the data label to include relevant units (e.g., "$", "%") for clarity.
   3. **Background and Borders**: Use background colors or borders to make the card visually distinct from other visuals on the dashboard.
   4. **Title Formatting**: Ensure the title of the card clearly describes what the number represents, such as "Total Sales" or "Customer Count."

### **2. Multirow Card Visual**

A **Multirow Card Visual** displays multiple key data points in a single visual. Itâ€™s an efficient way to present several numbers or metrics at once in a compact format, allowing users to compare different KPIs at a glance.

---

#### **Real-time Scenario Example**:
   - **Use Case**: A marketing dashboard tracks multiple metrics like total clicks, conversions, cost per acquisition (CPA), and total ad spend.
     - The **Multirow Card Visual** displays these four key metrics side-by-side (e.g., 10,000 clicks, 500 conversions, $20 CPA, $10,000 ad spend).
     - **Result**: Marketers can quickly compare all key performance indicators (KPIs) in one place, facilitating faster decision-making.

---

#### **Advantages**:
   - **Compact**: Displays multiple metrics in a small amount of space, making it ideal for dashboards with limited room.
   - **Multi-Metric Comparison**: Allows for easy comparison of several key metrics in one visual.
   - **Clean Layout**: Organizes multiple numbers in a clean and structured format, making it easier for users to consume the data.

---

#### **Disadvantages/Challenges**:
   - **Limited Depth**: Like the Card Visual, the Multirow Card doesnâ€™t provide trend data or comparisons over time.
   - **Fixed Layout**: The layout is static, so it may not be suitable for displaying a large number of metrics or KPIs.
   - **No Interaction**: Lacks interactivity, meaning users canâ€™t drill down into the data.

---

#### **Key Formatting Tips**:
   1. **Uniform Font Size**: Ensure all numbers are formatted with the same font size and style to maintain consistency.
   2. **Data Labels**: Clearly label each data point (e.g., "Revenue," "Cost per Lead") to ensure users understand what each number represents.
   3. **Spacing and Alignment**: Adjust spacing between metrics to make the visual clean and easy to read.
   4. **Background and Borders**: Add subtle backgrounds or borders to visually separate the different metrics.

### **When to Use Card vs. Multirow Card**

- **Use Card Visuals** when you need to display a single, high-priority metric, such as total revenue, customer count, or profit.
- **Use Multirow Card Visuals** when you want to compare multiple key metrics (like KPIs) in one place without taking up too much space on the report.

---

**Conclusion**:  
Both **Card** and **Multirow Card** visuals are excellent for presenting key metrics in a clear, concise format. While the **Card Visual** is ideal for emphasizing one number, the **Multirow Card Visual** is perfect for comparing several metrics at once. With the right formatting, these visuals can significantly improve the readability and effectiveness of your Power BI reports.
