# Earthquake Dashboard - Power BI

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **Earthquake Dashboard** project developed using Power BI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of earthquake occurrences, focusing on their magnitude, depth, distribution, and temporal patterns. This interactive dashboard allows users to explore earthquake data to gain valuable insights into seismic activity across different regions and over time.

## Objectives

- **Earthquake Magnitude Analysis**: Understand the distribution of earthquakes by magnitude, identifying the most common and severe seismic events.
- **Depth and Magnitude Relationships**: Analyze the relationship between earthquake depth and magnitude to understand seismic patterns.
- **Global Distribution Visualization**: Map earthquakes to visualize their global distribution, highlighting seismic hotspots.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Examine earthquake occurrences by month and year to identify trends and patterns over time.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard that enables exploration of earthquake data through various filters, including magnitude type and time range.
- **Magnitude Distribution**: Histogram showing the frequency of earthquakes by magnitude, helping identify the most common seismic events.
- **Geographical Mapping**: A map displaying the global distribution of earthquakes, highlighting areas with high seismic activity.
- **Depth Analysis**: Histogram and scatter plot visualizing the relationship between earthquake depth and magnitude, revealing depth patterns of seismic events.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Bar and line charts showing earthquake occurrences by month and year, identifying periods of increased seismic activity.

## Insights from the Dashboard

1. **Total Earthquakes**:

   - The dashboard captures data for 754 recorded earthquakes, providing an extensive view of seismic activity over time.

2. **Magnitude Distribution**:

   - Most earthquakes have a magnitude between 6 and 7, with a few events reaching magnitudes of 8 or higher, indicating significant seismic activity.

3. **Monthly Earthquake Patterns**:

   - May and March show the highest earthquake occurrences, suggesting these months experience relatively higher seismic activity compared to others.

4. **Global Earthquake Distribution**:

   - The map highlights that earthquakes are primarily concentrated along tectonic plate boundaries, especially in regions such as the Pacific Ring of Fire, parts of Asia, and western parts of the Americas.

5. **Depth and Magnitude Relationships**:

   - Most earthquakes occur at shallow depths (0-200 km), with a notable decrease in occurrences as depth increases, highlighting typical seismic behavior.

6. **Yearly Earthquake Trends**:
   - A notable increase in seismic events is observed in certain periods, with peaks indicating years of higher seismic activity, which may be due to increased tectonic movements.

## Project Learnings

Throughout this project, I developed skills in:

- **Data Visualization**: Created engaging and interactive visualizations using Power BI to clearly communicate key insights about seismic activity.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed complex earthquake data sets to extract valuable information about global seismic trends and patterns.
- **Dashboard Design**: Designed a well-structured and visually appealing dashboard, enabling users to explore and analyze earthquake data effortlessly.
- **Exploring Relationships**: Utilized scatter plots and histograms to reveal relationships between earthquake magnitude and depth, providing deeper insights into seismic behavior.
